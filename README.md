## Dairy Product Consumption

> In conclusion, the overview of 8 meta-analyses, including >3.6 million participants and >680,000 mortality cases, shows that **dairy product consumption is not associated with risk of all-cause mortality**. The dose-response, type of dairy product (milk, cheese, yogurt, or butter), and type of fat content (low- compared with high-fat) analyses further confirm the lack of association between dairy product consumption and all-cause mortality.
